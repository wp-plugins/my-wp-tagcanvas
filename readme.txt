My WP-TagCanvas draws and animates a HTML5 canvas based tag cloud. 


== Description ==

The plugin gets a 3D Tag cloud from Graham Breach's TagCanvas (http://www.goat1000.com/tagcanvas.php). TagCanvas is a Javascript class that draws and animates a HTML5 canvas based tag cloud. It supports following shapes: sphere, hcylinder for a cylinder that starts off horizontal, vcylinder for a cylinder that starts off vertical, hring for a horizontal circle and vring for a vertical circle. My WP-TagCanvas is derivative of Harry Xu's WP-TagCanvas v. 1.3.1 plugin and is based on TagCanvas v. 2.4. It supports Taxonomy, meaning that the Tag Cloud may consist of Post Tags or Categories or both mixed. The Number of tags is also adjustable.
