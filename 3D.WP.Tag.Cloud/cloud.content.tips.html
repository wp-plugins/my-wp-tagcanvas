<p><span>1. </span>Through WP <span>Links</span> panel you can create content for your cloud that consists of images instead of text. The URLs may be those of menu options, post categories, pages, archives, selected posts or even post authors. For "how to do it" look in <span>How to... Tips</span> section below.</p>
<p><span>2. </span>If you want to use <span>Recent Posts</span> option bare in mind that post titles are much longer than a single word.
So you have to apply it with <span>Split Width</span> option, giving a value of around 100-130px to the latter. 
In addition keep the <span>Number of Posts</span> around 10.</p>
<p><span>3. </span>When you create a menu in WP through <span>Appearance > Menus</span> panel you may not use it in the Header of your WP Theme.
Instead add it into a cloud via <span>Content > Menu</span> option and locate the widget instance in preferred place of your Home Page. 
You may not use even WP <span>Menus</span> panel, because you can put menu's options in the WP <span>Links</span> section and create category of hidden links that will be used only by the cloud and presented as rotating 3D Menu.</p>
<p><span>4. </span>Be aware that subject to weighting could be all types of Cloud's content except Menu and Pages.</p>
