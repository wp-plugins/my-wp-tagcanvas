<p><span>1. How to create a Tag Cloud of images</span><br>
3D WP Tag Cloud can show images if it consists of Links or Recent Posts. 
In the case of Recent Posts you have to provide them with a Featured Image (preferably thumbnail size). 
But generally speaking for making cloud of images you'd better use the other option - Links.  
<br>
So first create a Link Category in the Links Section of Administration Panel. Fill it up with some links. 
Do not forget to attach images to them. Its good to use one size for all. 80x80px would do fine. Make all links hidden. 
By this they will not appear elsewhere but in your widget instance. The text of the link does not matter - it will not be shown. 
(The option for showing both - the image and the text of the links is envisaged for the future.)
<br>
As a matter of fact, this is another way to create a cloud of Post Titles, Menu Options and/or Post Categories but this time presenting them by images.
