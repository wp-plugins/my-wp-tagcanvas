<p><span>1. </span>If you want to apply <span>Multiple Colors</span> don't forget to empty <span>Tags</span> Color field. If you want to apply <span>Multiple Backgrounds</span> type in <span>Background</span> field <span>tag</span>. Otherwise even if <span>Multiple Colors</span> and <span>Multiple Backgrounds</span> are specified they will not take effect.
<p><span>2. </span>In addition to he above be known that <span>Gradient</span> Colors that <span>color</span> and <span>both</span> options of <span>Weight Mode</span> use, override <span>Multiple Colors</span>. 
In the same way they override <span>Multiple Backgrounds</span> when <span>Weight Mode</span> is <span>bgcolor</span>. In other words <span>Multiple Colors</span> and <span>Multiple Backgrounds</span> may work when <span>Weight Mode</span> is <span>size</span> or <span>none</span>.
<p><span>3. </span>You have to insert 4 colors for using <span>Gradient</span>, but you don't have to insert 4 different colors! For example you may choose: color at 0: #ff0; color at 0.33: <span>#33ff00</span>; color at 0.67: <span>#33ff00</span> and color at 1: #006633. In this case the #33ff00 color will take longer part of the <span>Gradient</span> and it will become more greenish.
