<p><span>1. </span>When you use <span>Archives</span> or <span>Authors</span> for Cloud Content, there might be a big difference between number of posts in the months or between authors' publications. 
Since those numbers are base for weighting that will lead to extremely big size of some tags and extremely small for others. That is why you have to put limits using <span>Weight Size Max</span> and <span>Weight Size Min</span>. 
Good practise is to limit maximal font height to around 24px and minimal to around 9px.</p>
<p><span>2. </span>By changing <span>Radius X</span>, <span>Radius Y</span> and <span>Radius Z</span> you can modify the <span>shape</span> of the Cloud.
