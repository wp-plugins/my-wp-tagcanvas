<h3>General Tips</h3>
<div class="section_content">
	<p><span>1. </span>Keep <span>Settings Tooltips</span> ON while you get familiar with plugin options.</p>
	<p><span>2. </span>If after installation of a new plugin's version your existing clouds disappear, just open already created widget instances and save them again without any changes.</p>
	<p><span>3. </span>Get clue for plugin abilities from these Single & Multiple Cloud <a style="color:#1e8cbe; font-weight: bold;" href="http://peter.bg/archives/7373" target="_blank">examples</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3>Shape Tips</h3>
<div class="section_content">
	<p><span>1. </span>Be aware that some shapes need specific number of tags in order to look completed. These are: <span>3D axes</span>, <span>Christmas fir</span>, <span>Concentric 
	circles</span>, <span>Cube</span>, <span>Hexagon</span> (Bee Cell), <span>Lighthouse beam</span>, <span>Parabolic antenna</span>, <span>Peg top</span> (horizontal & vertical), 
	<span>Sandglass</span>, <span>Spiral</span>, <span>Square</span>, <span>Triangle</span> and <span>Triangle pyramid</span> (Tetrahedron). Because of that if the 
	tags in your cloud are less than what you have set in corresponding <span>Number</span> field the plugin will build a level smaller shape. When tags reach that number, 
	plugin will build a level bigger shape. Here is an example: You want shape <span>Cube</span> for your <span>Post tags</span> and the <span>Number</span> you have selected is 
	<span>26</span>. But the real number of tags you have is 15. In this case plugin will build a cube of 8 tags (2x2x2). When tags in your blog increase to 26, plugin will build 3x3x3 
	cube cloud (26 and not 27 because it is a shell only).</p>
	<p><span>2. </span>It's good to take in view following recommendations for your <span>Shape</span> choice:<br>
	- <span>3D axes</span>: Suitable for relatively small (18 - 36) number of image tags - <span>Links</span>, <span>Pages</span>, <span>Authors</span> and <span>Menu</span>. 
	As well as for <span>Post Tags</span> and <span>Categories</span> when tags are short words.<br>
	- <span>Balls</span>: Nice shape, good for any type and number of tags. Those in the middle overlap each other due to specificity of the shape.<br>
	- <span>Blossom</span>: Good for any type and number of tags.<br>
	- <span>Bulb</span>: Good for any type and number of tags.<br>
	- <span>Egg</span>: Good for any type and number of tags.<br>
	- <span>Candy</span>: Good for any type and number of tags. Those in both ends overlap each other due to specificity of the shape.<br>
	- <span>Capsule</span>: Good for any type and number of tags.<br>
	- <span>Christmas fir</span>: Better for image tags. Nicer for rotation around Y-axis. In that case the top tag stays still and could be used for an important link.<br>
	- <span>Concentric circles</span>: Flat shape where the tag in the center is still. This feature can be used for important tags - special pages, authors or links.
	Suitable for image gallery. Good for bigger number of tags (30+).<br>
	- <span>Cube</span>: Good for any type of cloud content and tags.<br>
	- <span>Cylinder that starts off horizontal</span> & <span>Cylinder that starts off vertical</span> are good for any type of content and tags.<br>
	- <span>Glass</span>: Good for any type and number of tags but those on the stem overlap each other.<br>
	- <span>Globe</span>: Good for any type of content and tags but bigger number of latter make shape nicer.<br>
	- <span>Heart</span>: Suitable for bigger cloud size and small number of tags (20 or 30), preferably icons.<br>
	- <span>Hexagon</span> (Bee cell): Another flat shape where the tag in the center is still. This feature can be used for important tags - special pages, authors or links. 
	Suitable for image gallery. Good for bigger number of tags (30+).<br>
	- <span>Horizontal ring</span> & <span>Vertical ring</span> are suitable for any type of content and tags. Good for rotation around one axis - X or Y.<br>
	- <span>Knot</span>: Good for any type and number of tags.<br>
	- <span>Lemon</span>: Good for any type and number of tags.<br>
	- <span>Lighthouse beam</span>: Suitable for very small (5 - 10) number of image tags - <span>Menu</span>. First tag in the beam is anchored (it could be the 
	Home page). Set <span>Depth</span> to 1 for better result.
	<span>Pages</span> and <span>Authors</span> are also suitable if their number is up to 10.<br>
	- <span>Parabolic antenna</span> is a compound shape and is suitable for image tags. Not suitable for <span>Recent posts</span>, <span>Archives</span> due to the length of their tag text.
	By the same reason not suitable for <span>Authors</span>, unless they are presented with their avatars only.<br>
	- <span>Peg top that starts off horizontal</span> & <span>Peg top that starts off vertical</span> (Twin Cones) are suitable for bigger number of image or 
	short text tags. Good for rotation around one axis - X or Y. Not suitable for <span>Menu</span>, <span>Recent posts</span> and other types of content with small number of tags.<br>
	- <span>Sandglass</span>: This shape needs more tags. Looks better with images. Not suitable for <span>Menu</span>, <span>Recent posts</span> and other types 
	of content with small number of tags.<br>
	- <span>Sphere</span>: Good for any type of cloud content and tags.<br>
	- <span>Spiral</span>: One more flat shape where the tag in the center is still. This feature can be used for important tags - special pages, authors or links.<br>
	- <span>Square</span>: Also flat shape, preferable for image tags. No anchored tag in the center. Not suitable for too big number of tags. Good for image galery.<br>
	- <span>Staircase</span>: Looks great when rotates around Y-axis and is built of bigger number of tags (preferably images) - let say 60-70. Not suitable for 
	<span>Menu</span> and <span>Recent posts</span> and other types of content with small number of tags.<br>
	- <span>Stool</span>: Good for any type and number of tags.<br>
	- <span>Tower of rings</span> & <span>Roller of rings</span> are good for any type of content and tags. Nice for image gallery. The difference between them 
	and both <span>Cylinder that starts off horizontal</span> & <span>Cylinder that starts off vertical</span> is in distribution of tags on their surface.<br>
	- <span>Triangle</span>: Flat shape. No anchored tag in the center. Not suitable for too big number of tags. Good for image gallery<br>
	- <span>Triangle pyramid</span> (Tetrahedron): Good for any type of cloud content and tags.</p>
	<p><span>3. </span>Don't be surprised that <span>Radius Z</span> option disappears when 1D or 2D shape (<span>Beam</span>, <span>Concentric circles</span>, <span>Spiral</span>, 
	<span>Square</span>, <span>Triangle</span> and <span>Hexagon</span>) is selected.</p>
</div>
<h3>Cloud Content Tips</h3>
<div class="section_content">
	<p><span>1. </span>Through WP <span>Links</span> panel you can create content for your cloud that consists of images instead of text. The URLs may be those of menu options, post categories, pages, archives, selected posts or even post authors. For "how to do it" look in <span>How to... Tips</span> section below.</p>
	<p><span>2. </span>If you want to use <span>Recent Posts</span> option bare in mind that post titles are much longer than a single word.
	So you have to apply it with <span>Split Width</span> option, giving a value of around 80-100px to the latter. 
	In addition keep the <span>Number of Posts</span> around 10.</p>
	<p><span>3. </span>Be aware that any post without title will make your <span>Recent Posts</span> Cloud Disappear.
	<p><span>4. </span>When you create a menu in WP through <span>Appearance > Menus</span> panel you may not use it in the Header of your WP Theme.
	Instead add it into a cloud via <span>Content > Menu</span> option and locate the widget instance in preferred place of your Home Page. 
	You may not use even WP <span>Menus</span> panel, because you can put menu's options in the WP <span>Links</span> section and create category of hidden links that will be used only by the cloud and presented as rotating 3D Menu.</p>
	<p><span>5. </span>Be aware that subject to weighting could be all types of Cloud's content except <span>Menu</span> and <span>Pages</span>.</p>
</div>
<h3>Coloring Tips</h3>
<div class="section_content">
	<p><span>1. </span>If you want to apply <span>Multiple Colors</span> don't forget to empty <span>Tags</span> Color field. If you want to apply <span>Multiple Backgrounds</span> type in <span>Background</span> field <span>tag</span>. Otherwise even if <span>Multiple Colors</span> and <span>Multiple Backgrounds</span> are specified they will not take effect.
	<p><span>2. </span>In addition to he above be known that <span>Gradient</span> Colors that <span>color</span> and <span>size & color</span> options of <span>Weight Mode</span> use, override <span>Multiple Colors</span>. 
	In the same way they override <span>Multiple Backgrounds</span> when <span>Weight Mode</span> is <span>bgcolor</span>. In other words <span>Multiple Colors</span> and <span>Multiple Backgrounds</span> may work when <span>Weight Mode</span> is <span>size</span>.
	<p><span>3. </span>You have to insert 4 colors for using <span>Gradient</span>, but you don't have to insert 4 different values! For example you may choose: color at 0: <span>#ff0</span>; color at 0.33: <span>#33ff00</span>; color at 0.67: <span>#33ff00</span> and color at 1: <span>#006633</span>. In this case the #33ff00 color will take longer part of the <span>Gradient</span> and it will become more greenish.
</div>
<h3>Sizing Tips</h3>
<div class="section_content">
	<p><span>1. </span>In order to fit your Cloud into widget's frame you can use not only <span>Radius X</span>, <span>Radius Y</span> and <span>Radius Z</span> but widget's <span>Height</span> or <span>Width</span>. 
	This is because clouds are calculated for square space. So when one of widget's sizes is smaller than the other it determines the space for the cloud.
	<p><span>2. </span>By changing one or two of <span>Radius X</span>, <span>Radius Y</span> and <span>Radius Z</span> you can modify the <span>shape</span> of the Cloud. 
	<p><span>3. </span>When you use <span>Archives</span> or <span>Authors</span> for Cloud Content, there might be a big difference between number of posts in the months or between authors' publications. 
	Since those numbers are base for weighting that will lead to extremely big size of some tags and extremely small for others. That is why you have to put limits using <span>Weight Size Max</span> and <span>Weight Size Min</span>. 
	Good practise is to limit maximal font height to around 24px and minimal to around 9px.</p>
	<p><span>4. </span>The size of your images in the Cloud can be changed by <span>Image Scale</span>. Nevertheless you have to know following: Plugin automatically resizes them to 
	96x96px for <span>Authors</span>, <span>Links</span> & <span>Menu</span> or 120x120px for <span>Pages</span> & <span>Recent Posts</span>. 
	Due to perspective images become smaller at Cloud's back but bigger at its front. So if their real size is 96x96px (respectively 120x120px) 
	their resolution will worsen at Cloud's front. That's why use images that are at least 10% bigger than the above sizes. Increasing 
	<span>Image Scale</span> over <span>1</span> may also worsen resolution if it is not considered with the real size of images, so don't forget it.</p>
</div>
<h3>Speed Tips</h3>
<div class="section_content">
	<p><span>1. </span>The best <span>Initial Speed</span> is between 0.1-0.4.</p>
	<p><span>2. </span>Reduce <span>Max Speed</span> to 0.2 for nice results with <span>Drag Control</span>.</p>
	<p><span>3. </span>Do not get confused by units of <span>Max Speed</span>. Think about it as a multiplier of speed.</p>
</div>
<h3>Tooltips Tips</h3>
<div class="section_content">
	<p><span>1. </span>If you want to apply a Canvas tooltip but your <span>Menu</span> or <span>Link</span> tags also have their own and it becomes a mess of tooltip pop-ups, 
	then remove links' <span>Description</span> (in <span>Links</span> panel) and <span>Title Attribute</span> of your menu items (in <span>Appearance > Menus</span> panel). 
	Thus <span>Links</span> and <span>Menu</span> tags will not have title attribute. Hence there will not be tag tooltips.</p>
	<p><span>2. </span>You can't do the above if your cloud content consists of <span>Categories</span> or <span>Post tags</span>. In that case you'd better not apply Canvas tooltip.</p>
</div>
<h3>How to... Tips</h3>
<div class="section_content" style="padding-bottom: 0;">
	<div id="accordion-6" style="padding: 0 0 3px;">
		<h3 style="margin-top: 5px;">1. How to create a Tag Cloud of images</h3>
		<div class="section_content"> 
			<p>
				3D WP Tag Cloud can show images if it consists of <span>Links</span>, <span>Menu</span>, <span>Pages</span> or <span>Recent Posts</span>. 
				In the case of <span>Recent Posts</span> and <span>Pages</span> you have to provide your posts and pages with a <span>Featured Image</span>.
				The <span>Menu</span> case is explained in tip #2.
				For making cloud of images via <span>Links</span>, in other words for creating a rotating blogroll you have to:   
			</p>
			<p>
				Create a Link Category in the <span>Links</span> Section of WP Admin Panel. Fill it up with some links. Attach images to them. Its good to use one size for all. 
				80x80px would do fine. Make all links hidden. By this they will not appear elsewhere but in your widget instance. The text of the link does not matter - it will not 
				be shown. If you type into Description field of a link it will become a tooltip of its tag.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a matter of fact, this is another way to create a cloud of Menu Options, Pages, Archives and/or Post Categories but this time presenting them by images.  
			</p>
			</div>
		<h3>2. How to create a Menu of images for a Tag Cloud</h3>
		<div class="section_content">
			<p>
				Let's suppose you have created a menu in <span>Menus</span> panel. You'd better keep it switched off (i.e. not located on your theme as Primary or whatever). 
				Click on the first menu item to edit it. Add an HTML tag for your image in <span>Navigation Label</span> field, where the text of the menu item is.
				Let's assume this menu item is for your Home page, and the text in <span>Navigation Label</span> reads <span>Home</span>. 
				After you add the HTML tag the content of the field should look like this:<br>
				<span>&lt;img src="http://your-domain.com/your-folder/your-image.jpg"&gt;Home</span><br> It is good to	use small square (let say 108x6108px) images. 
				Repeat the above operation with all items and save the menu. After that go to your widget instance, choose <span>Menu</span> as <span>CONTENT</span> of your cloud 
				and play with the settings in <span>MIXED IMAGE & TEXT</span> section.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>3. How to anchor an important tag?</h3>
		<div class="section_content">
			<p>
				An easy way to anchor a tag is to set <span>Shape</span> to <span>hring</span> and <span>Lock Rotation</span> to <span>y-axis</span>. When tags are odd number one 
				of them will stay still (the one at the bottom). In case of even number two will be anchored (those at the bottom and at the top). This is suitable for creating a 
				cloud of <span>Pages</span> or <span>Menu</span>, where	you want the most important menu item or page (let say 'Home' or 'Contacts') anchored at the bottom. In case of 
				<span>Menu</span> this will be the first item in Menu Structure (WP Appearance > Menus). In case of <span>Pages</span> it will be the first in alphabetical order. 
				When menu items or pages are even number, the one in the beginning of second half will be anchored at the top. See this <a href="http://peter.bg/archives/7373#anchor" target="_blank"><b>example</b></a>.

		<h3>4. How to create a Slideshow Imitation</h3>
		<div class="section_content">
			<p>
				Usually Slideshows are like a ribbon - short and wide. So how to create a short and wide widget instance that imitates slideshow?<br><br>
				1. Make sure you have enough wide sidebar for the widget;<br>
				2. Choose <span>Single Cloud</span> mode;<br>
				2. Create list of Image Links in the Links Section of WP Admin Panel <i>(See above "How to create Tag Cloud of images".)</i>;<br>
				3. Create a widget instance with following option values:<br>
					- <span>Widget Height</span>: ... <i>(We assume that it must be short, so start with the shortest value plugin offers: 160px.)</i>;<br>
					- <span>Shape</span>: vring;<br>
					- <span>Content</span>: links;<br>
					- <span>Links Category</span>: ... <i>(the category you created for the purpose above)</i>;<br>
					- <span>Radius X, Radius Z</span>: ... (Set equal values about 6.5 or above for both, assuming that images are around 140x140px. If images are wider increase 
					Radiuses. No need to play with Radius Y.)<br>
					- <span>Drag Control</span>: on;<br>
					- <span>Widget Tooltip</span>: Drag or Click;<br>
					- <span>Lock Rotation</span>: y;<br>
					- <span>Min Opacity</span>: 0;<br>
					- <span>Initial Speed [x,y]</span>: 0.15, 0 <i>(or [-0.15, 0] depending on initial direction of rotation you prefer)</i>;<br>
					- <span>Min Speed</span>: 0.005<br>
					- <span>Max Speed</span>: 0.01

		<h3>5. How to put your logo in the center of the cloud</h3>
		<div class="section_content">
			<p>
				Use <span>Center Function</span> option in <span>BG IMG, TOOLTIPS, CURSOR, CENTER FN</span> section. Choose function 
				<span>image_cf()</span> and enter <span>URL</span> of your image (<span>http://your-site.com/your-folder/your-image.png</span>). 
				It is advisable to use png format images due to advantage of transparency. It is good if image sizes are equal to widget's 
				<span class='green'>Width,</span> and <span class='green'>Height</span> or bigger but in same proportion. 
				Opaque part of it should look compact and be in the center. Plugin will resize image so that tags pass along without "bumping" in it.
				For creating your own functions you need to be fluent in HTML5 and particularly in <span>&#60;canvas&#62;</span> drawing. If you are not - learning is easy. 
				Here are two useful tutorials:<br>
				<a style="color:#1e8cbe; font-weight: bold;" href="http://diveintohtml5.info/canvas.html" target="_blank">LET'S CALL IT A DRAW(ING SURFACE)</a><br>
				and<br>
				<a style="color:#1e8cbe; font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp" target="_blank">HTML5 Canvas</a>.<br>
				For time being now you can use and modify following ready made samples that give you the three basic possibilities: to add image, to add text and to rotate created object:
